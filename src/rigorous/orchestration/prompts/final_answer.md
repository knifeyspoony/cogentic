{question}

Consider the previous messages; did we come to a final answer through the team conversation? 

- If so, respond with that final answer.
- If not, THAT'S OK, let the user know that the results are incomplete, and summarize why we weren't able to come to a final answer.

### CRITICALLY IMPORTANT NOTE

It's very important that you do not make up an answer if the previous messages don't have verified evidence to support it. Failure is OK.
