## Plan Update

There doesn't appear to be any remaining work on the current hypothesis (no tests are incomplete):

### Updating or Completing the Hypothesis

If, based on the completed tests, you believe that our work on the current hypothesis is complete (or that it cannot be completed), please mark the state accordingly. We want to be rigorous, but not impossibly pedantic; if the test results give you a moderate amount of confidence in the hypothesis, you can mark it as verified.

#### State of the Hypothesis

You may need to change the state of the hypothesis. Here are the possible states:

- unverified: the hypothesis has not been verified and you are adding new, viable tests to continue our work
- verified: the hypothesis has been verified based on the test results and you are marking it as complete
- unverifiable: the hypothesis cannot be verified due to the current team composition or team member failures

#### Updating Tests

- If you are leaving the current hypothesis as unverified, you must add some additional tests that can be completed by our team members to continue our work.
- If you are abandoning the hypothesis, leave the tests in the abandoned hypothesis as they are so we can review the results later.

### Updating the Plan

In completing our work, we may have learned something new. If so, consider modifying our plan to adjust accordingly e.g., if:

- We learned that a certain approach is not feasible, we may want to remove related work from our plan.
- We learned that a certain approach is feasible, we may want to add related work to our plan and remove any work that is no longer needed.
- New facts have come to light as a result of our work, we may want to update our plan accordingly.

We don't want to remove hypotheses from the plan - if we don't plan to continue work on a hypothesis, just mark it accordingly and potentially create new ones.

#### Plan Tips

- We can't interact with the physical world, and you're basically limited to whatever functionality your team members have. Keep this in mind when you design hypotheses and tests.
