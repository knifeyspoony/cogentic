## Update the Progress Ledger

### Progress Questions

To make progress on answering the question, please answer the following questions, including necessary reasoning:

- First, consider the current test - have we gathered any supporting evidence for it?
- Is our original question fully answered? (True if complete, or False if the original request has yet to be successfully addressed)
- Are we in a loop where we are repeating the same requests and / or getting the same responses as before? 
  Loops can span multiple turns, and can include repeated actions like scrolling up or down more than a handful of times.
- Are we making forward progress?
    - True if just starting, or recent messages are adding value.
    - False if recent messages show evidence of being stuck in a loop or if there is evidence of significant barriers to success such as the inability to read from a required file

### New Facts

We also want to keep track of any _new_ facts that may have come to light.
If we're getting an error when running a test, we should note this in our facts.

### Notes about New Facts

- New facts MUST be based on test results or errors.
- Please do not include any facts that require further validation.
- You can include problematic test_results in the fact sheet, e.g., 
  - A given team member keeps having issues
  - A specific tool is broken or unavailable.

### Test Results

- If we've completed the current test, update the test details in the ledger.
- If we are unable to complete a test and the error appears permanent, please consider abandoning the test.

### Previous Ledger

If we're continuing work on this question, please consider the previous ledger below.

### Final Note about Updating the Ledger

- If we have supporting evidence for the current test, without too much scrutiny, consider whether it successfully completes the test.
- If the test is completed, consider whether the results complete the hypothesis.
- If the hypothesis is completed, consider whether it answers our original question.
- If so, we're done!
