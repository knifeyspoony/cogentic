## Select Next Speaker

To make progress on answering the question, please answer the following questions, including necessary reasoning:

- Who should speak next? (select from: {names})
- What instruction or question would you give this team member? (Phrase as if speaking directly to them, and include any specific information they may need)

### No Viable Speaker Situation

If no team member is appropriate due to persistent issues and no viable alternatives are available, then don't provide a next speaker; we'll need to regroup and start over.
